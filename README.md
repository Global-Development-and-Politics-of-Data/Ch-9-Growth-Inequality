# Ch-9-Growth-Inequality
A repository for Chapter 9 on Economic Growth and Inequality - Spring 2021 PRP

# Why we are doing this

The data work for our chapter involves work around indicators and indices on growth and inequality that are built upon measuring population, and national or domestic economic activity. 
For comparison purposes between countries, there is a heavy reliance on statistical methods to obtain comparable numbers. The sources of the producers of the indicators are usually household surveys or national accounts systems. Therefore, there are common flaws across the different indicators and each one offers diverse scopes over the economic growth or inequality.
The primary purpose of our data work delves into cleaning and tidying our data in such a fashion that it is reproducible by the student. At the same time, given the varying methodologies and subtle differences, the data management practices contribute to evidence that subtlety and handle the building of different indicators based on similar raw data. Moreover, the data visualization will help in analyzing the issues around growth and inequality indicators.
The major challenges while completing our work is to continue adhering to our workflow. It is easy to digress when using multiple tools and platforms with big datasets. Also, another major challenge is the analyses of longitudinal and cross-sectional data. The main indicators detailed in the chapter constrain our quest for measurement validity. Even more, the challenge is enhanced because our learning objectives invite the students to initiate their path on critical thinking of metadata and of existing indicators. 
Our detailed data work is important for understanding the “politics of data” because of the pretended effects of measuring GDP to account for non-economic standards. Unidimensional approaches to economic growth highlight the correlation between GDP and other aspects of well-being such as healthcare or education. There are even multidimensional indexes that consider GNI with years of education and life expectancy, such as the Human Development Index, that takes into consideration both economic and non-economic measurements.
Moreover, the incentives to purposely under or over estimate economic growth introduce bias or noise in the available data. Then, our analysis aims to reduce the bias in the indicators by using different indicators on a given unit or time series. For example, the use of the Gini coefficient and the Theil index can show different trends for Peru’s inequality between 1970 and 2020. 
In terms of research design, our data work is important because it prepares the student for inductive research. Along with the literature review available in the chapter, the data revolution entices the investigation of empirical data, and that is one major focus of this module.
